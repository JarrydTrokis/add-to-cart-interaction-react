A short coding exercise - where I had to replicate the add to
cart interaction found [here](https://codyhouse.co/demo/add-to-cart-interaction/index.html)

I gave myself a maximum of 4 hours to complete this challenge. I focused
heavily on the logic/functionality of the app, rather than the presentation.
This is built in React and was started & completed using [codesandbox.io](codesandbox.io).

I'm hugely impressed with CodeSandbox as a platform for bringing code editing and code hosting to
the cloud. I was able to write my code, link dependencies and test the application in a live view, all
from the comfort of a browswer window.
